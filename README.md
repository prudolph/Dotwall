Dotwall
=======
The Dot wall project inspired by BreakfastNY's Electromagnetic Dot Display (http://breakfastny.com/projects/). Unfortunally I did not have the funds to purchase a giant dot display to experiment with. 
So I decided to make a projection using cinder. The project uses a Leap motion controller to interact with the wall and control the dots.
